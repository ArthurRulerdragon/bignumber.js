## BigNumber.js

BigNumber.js is a simple, light javascript library for node.js and the browser.

It has the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^, abs) and provides an
extremely easy to use API. It works with both positive and negative integers
and internally stores the number in an array.

It's also blazing fast.

Egg:
    n(5).plus(97).minus(53).plus(434).multiply(5435423).add(321453).multiply(21).div(2).pow(2) = 760056543044267246001
